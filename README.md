# Cul::Omniauth

Cul::Omniauth is a gem that facilitates using Rails, [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise "Devise") and Omniauth with the [CAS offering from Columbia University IT](https://cuit.columbia.edu/cas-authentication "CUIT CAS Documentation").

At this time, this gem only supports Columbia University's CAS3 authentication endpoint (which provides user affiliation information), but support for additional auth mechanisms may be added later if needed.

## Installation and setup

The instructions below assume that your Rails application's user model will be called "User".

1. Add gem `devise` (>= 4.9) to your Gemfile.
2. Follow the standard Devise setup instructions (https://github.com/heartcombo/devise).  Recap:
   1. `rails generate devise:install`
   2. `rails generate devise User`
   3. `rails db:migrate`
3. Add gem `omniauth` (>= 2.1) to your Gemfile.
4. Add this gem, 'omniauth-cul', to your Gemfile.
5. Run `bundle install`.
6. Add a :uid column to the User model by running: `rails generate migration AddUidToUsers uid:string:uniq:index`
7. In `/app/models/user.rb`, find the line where the `devise` method is called (usually with arguments like `:database_authenticatable`, `:registerable`, etc.).  Add these additional arguments to the end of the method call: `:omniauthable, omniauth_providers: [:cas]`
8. In `/config/routes.rb`, find this line:
   ```
    devise_for :users
   ```
   And replace it with this:
   ```
    devise_for :users, controllers: { omniauth_callbacks: 'users/omniauth_callbacks' }
   ```
9.  Create a new file at `app/controllers/users/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb` with the following content:
   ```
   require 'omniauth/cul'

    class Users::OmniauthCallbacksController < Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController
      # Adding the line below so that if the auth endpoint POSTs to our cas endpoint, it won't
      # be rejected by authenticity token verification.
      # See https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/FAQ#rails-session-is-clobbered-after-callback-on-developer-strategy
      skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token, only: :cas

      def app_cas_callback_endpoint
        "#{request.base_url}/users/auth/cas/callback"
      end

      # GET /users/auth/cas (go here to be redirected to the CAS login form)
      def passthru
        redirect_to Omniauth::Cul::Cas3.passthru_redirect_url(app_cas_callback_endpoint), allow_other_host: true
      end

      # GET /users/auth/cas/callback
      def cas
        user_id, affils = Omniauth::Cul::Cas3.validation_callback(request.params['ticket'], app_cas_callback_endpoint)

        # Custom auth logic for your app goes here.
        # The code below is provided as an example.  If you want to use Omniauth::Cul::PermissionFileValidator,
        # to validate see the later "Omniauth::Cul::PermissionFileValidator" section of this README.
        #
        # if Omniauth::Cul::PermissionFileValidator.permitted?(user_id, affils)
        #   user = User.find_by(uid: user_id) || User.create!(
        #       uid: user_id,
        #       email: "#{user_id}@columbia.edu"
        #   )
        #   sign_in_and_redirect user, event: :authentication # this will throw if @user is not activated
        # else
        #   flash[:error] = 'Login attempt failed'
        #   redirect_to root_path
        # end
      end
    end
   ```

## Omniauth::Cul::PermissionFileValidator - Permission validation with a user id list or affiliation list

One of the modules in this gem is `Omniauth::Cul::PermissionFileValidator`, which can be used like this:

```
user_id = 'abc123'
affils = ['affil1']
if Omniauth::Cul::PermissionFileValidator.permitted?(user_id, affils)
  # This block will run if your Rails app has a file at /config/permissions.yml that
  # permits access for user 'abc123' OR any user with affiliation 'affil1'.
end
```

In your Rails app, your permission.yml file should be located at /config/permissions.yml.  For each environment, you may define allowed_user_ids and/or allowed_user_affils.

```
# Permissions

all: &all
  allowed_user_ids:
    - abc123
    - def123
    - ghi123
  allowed_user_affils:
    - CUL_dpts-ldpd

development: *all
test: *all
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
